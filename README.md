# Cube-Visualizer
Renders a 3D cube in ASCII characters through ray tracing

To build and run the project, run "make" then "./main". Press and hold the corresponding key to rotate the cube in that direction. Use "-h" to see how to change render settings.

The cube is rendered through a primitive implementation of ray tracing, with rotation being accomplished by rotating the camera and window around the world space. More info on this technique can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_tracing_(graphics)
